- 👋 Hi, I’m @ankush464
- 👀 I’m interested in DSA, Embedded Development, Problem Solving and anything technology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced data structures and algorithms, as well as diving deeper into embedded systems development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to DSA implementation, embedded systems projects, or any challenging problem-solving tasks.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once built a mini-robot that could solve a maze autonomously using a combination of DSA algorithms and embedded programming!
